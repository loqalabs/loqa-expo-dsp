# Story 5.1: Create Comprehensive README.md

Status: drafted

## Story
As a developer, I want a comprehensive README.md that explains the library's purpose, features, and quick start, so that users can quickly understand and adopt the library.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Given** package complete **When** writing README **Then** includes purpose, key features (FFT, pitch, formants, spectral), installation, and quick start
2. **Given** README created **When** checking examples **Then** shows code snippets for all four DSP functions
3. **Given** content complete **When** reviewing **Then** includes API overview, platform support, prerequisites, and links to detailed docs

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Write library overview and key features section
- [ ] Add installation instructions (npm install @loqalabs/loqa-audio-dsp)
- [ ] Create quick start examples for computeFFT, detectPitch, extractFormants, analyzeSpectrum
- [ ] Add prerequisites (React Native, Expo SDK version, iOS/Android requirements)
- [ ] Link to API.md and INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Add badges (npm version, license, build status)

## Dev Notes
### Learnings from Previous Story
**From Story 4-5**: All core DSP functions complete and tested. README should showcase all capabilities.
