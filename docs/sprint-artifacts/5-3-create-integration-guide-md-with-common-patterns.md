# Story 5.3: Create INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md with Common Patterns

Status: drafted

## Story
As a developer, I want an INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md with real-world patterns and recipes, so that I can implement common voice analysis use cases quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Given** API documented **When** writing guide **Then** includes patterns for voice recording integration, real-time analysis, batch processing
2. **Given** patterns documented **When** checking examples **Then** shows complete code for pitch tracking app, formant visualization, spectral analyzer
3. **Given** use cases complete **When** reviewing **Then** includes performance tips, memory management, error handling best practices

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Write voice recording integration pattern (expo-av)
- [ ] Write real-time analysis pattern (streaming audio)
- [ ] Write batch processing pattern (recorded files)
- [ ] Add complete example: pitch tracking app
- [ ] Add complete example: formant visualization
- [ ] Add performance and memory management section

## Dev Notes
### Learnings from Previous Story
**From Story 5-2**: API reference complete. Integration guide provides practical patterns.
